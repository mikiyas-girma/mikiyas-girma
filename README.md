### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## Introduction

I am a BSc in Software Engineering student and also pursuing a software engineering program given by ALX Africa in collaboration with Holberton School. I have a strong work ethic and effective time management skills. I am always eager to learn new things and passionate about using technology to address community issues. I believe that my skills, commitment, and passion can make a positive impact on the tech landscape.

## Experience

As part of the community-based training program (CBTP) education given in Jimma University, I had the opportunity to work with my team members on developing a full-stack web application. This application eases activities related to buying, selling, or renting properties and also helps users manage their own properties.

## Interest

I am deeply interested in the field of AI and data science.
